// Extract scr.rar or scr.zip folder (anyone will do)
// create new project into Eclipse or Netbeans.
// Replace "scr folder" with extracted "scr folder"
// Run "Main.java" file from default Package
// It will generate "output.txt" file on the current directory.

/* Project contains following files: 
- one Interface
- one abstract class
- Three concrete classes for each strategy
- one Main class.
*/

/*Note: As there are multiple files using reference from Abstract Class and Interface from other Package folders, program will run best on eclipse. */

/* Best Strategy from output*/

/*
Based on output for attached output file here, 2nd strategy looks good. 
But for determining best Strategy more number of runs are required. 
As per my observation here 3rd strategy is worst case, and it will almost lead to less balance than opening one. 2nd strategy can make good fortune or can lead to 0 balance compare to 1st one. Chances for both are same. With strategy 1, we can lose or win less compare to strategy 2. So if you want to reduce risk, we should go for strategy 1.
